# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It felt fairly reassuring. Putting everything we've learned together was a great way to check my progress and figure out what I need to work on.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is going smooth. I know that it will be exponentially different when mod 1 starts due to more work, but I have stayed organized and feel good.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
When to define a method and when not to.
